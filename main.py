    Welcome to the Tomato Plant Disease Detection System! üåøüîç
    
    Our mission is to help in identifying tomato plant diseases efficiently. Upload an image of a tomato plant, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of diseases. Together, let's protect our crops and ensure a healthier harvest!

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Disease Detection** page and upload an image of a tomato plant with suspected diseases.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
    3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.


    ### Get Started
    Click on the **Disease Detection** page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Tomato Plant Disease Detection System!

    ### About Us
    Learn more about the project, our team, and our goals on the **About** page.

                This dataset is recreated using offline augmentation from the original dataset.The original dataset can be found on Kaggle website.
                This dataset consists of 18456 rgb images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 10 different classes.The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure.
